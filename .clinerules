## 🔹 Core Rule: **Memory Resets Every Session**
I rely **100%** on the **Memory Bank**. I **must** read **all files** at the start of every task.

## 🔹 Memory Bank Structure
Stored in `docs/`. Uses **Markdown**. `.clinerules` is **read-only**.

🔹 Core Files (Required)

1️⃣ projectbrief.md – Foundation, scope, requirements.
2️⃣ productContext.md – Purpose, problems solved, UX goals.
3️⃣ activeContext.md – Current focus, decisions, next steps.
4️⃣ systemPatterns.md – Architecture, technical patterns.
5️⃣ techContext.md – Tech stack, setup, constraints.
6️⃣ progress.md – Status, completed work, open issues.

✅ Additional Files: API specs, testing plans, deployment guides.

🔹 Documentation Updates

Trigger updates when:
🔄 Discovering new patterns
🔄 Implementing significant changes
🔄 User requests "update memory bank" (Must review ALL files)
🔄 Context needs clarification

📌general rules for .txt or .md files: 

1️⃣Summarize existing texts to the same file while preserving technical accuracy. 
1️⃣ Remove redundancy.
3️⃣ use words that use smallest number of tokens while having the same meaning



📌 FINAL RULES:
1️⃣ Memory resets every session.
2️⃣ Memory Bank is my ONLY link to past work.
3️⃣ Keep it precise, structured, and up to date.
