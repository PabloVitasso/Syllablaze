# Syllablaze Product Context

## Why This Project Exists

Syllablaze exists to bridge the gap between spoken word and digital text. In today's fast-paced digital environment, many users need to quickly convert their spoken thoughts, meetings, lectures, or notes into text format. Traditional methods of transcription are time-consuming and often require specialized skills or services. Syllablaze provides an immediate, local solution that respects user privacy by processing all audio locally.

## Problems It Solves

1. **Time Efficiency**: Eliminates the need for manual transcription, saving users significant time
2. **Accessibility**: Makes content creation accessible to those who prefer speaking over typing
3. **Note-Taking**: Enables efficient note-taking during meetings, lectures, or brainstorming sessions
4. **Content Creation**: Facilitates the creation of written content through speech
5. **Accessibility Needs**: Assists users with physical limitations that make typing difficult
6. **Privacy Concerns**: Provides a local solution that doesn't send audio data to cloud services
7. **Resource Management**: Helps users manage disk space and processing power through flexible model selection

## How It Should Work

1. **Initialization**: The application starts and runs in the system tray, minimizing desktop clutter
2. **Recording**: Users can start recording through:
   - Clicking the system tray icon
   - Using configured global keyboard shortcuts
   - Right-clicking the tray icon and selecting "Start Recording"
3. **Feedback**: During recording, a progress window shows:
   - Visual volume meter indicating audio levels
   - Recording duration
   - Option to stop recording
4. **Processing**: When recording stops:
   - The progress window shows the transcription status
   - The Whisper model processes the audio locally
   - The application provides feedback on the transcription progress
5. **Completion**: After transcription:
   - The text is automatically copied to the clipboard
   - A notification confirms successful transcription
   - The user can immediately paste the text wherever needed
6. **Configuration**: Users can configure:
   - Input device selection
   - Whisper model selection (balancing speed vs. accuracy)
   - Global keyboard shortcuts
   - Interface preferences
   - Language settings for transcription
7. **Model Management**: Users can manage Whisper models through:
   - A table-based interface showing all available models
   - Visual indicators for downloaded vs. not-downloaded models
   - Buttons to download, delete, or set models as active
   - Information about model size and storage location

## User Experience Goals

1. **Simplicity**: The application should be intuitive and require minimal interaction
2. **Reliability**: Transcription should be consistent and accurate
3. **Responsiveness**: The application should provide immediate feedback on all actions
4. **Integration**: The application should feel like a natural extension of the KDE desktop
5. **Minimal Disruption**: The application should stay out of the way until needed
6. **Confidence**: Users should trust that their audio is being processed correctly
7. **Adaptability**: The application should work well in various environments and use cases
8. **Cross-platform Consistency**: The application should provide a consistent experience across different Linux distributions, with special attention to Ubuntu KDE
9. **Resource Awareness**: The application should help users make informed decisions about resource usage

## Target Users

1. **Students**: For transcribing lectures and study notes
2. **Professionals**: For meeting notes and quick memos
3. **Content Creators**: For drafting articles, blog posts, or scripts
4. **Researchers**: For recording and transcribing interviews or observations
5. **Accessibility Users**: For those who find typing difficult or impossible
6. **KDE Enthusiasts**: Users who appreciate well-integrated KDE applications
7. **Privacy-conscious Users**: Those who prefer local processing over cloud services
8. **Resource-constrained Users**: Those with limited disk space or processing power who need flexibility in model selection

## Enhanced Model Management Benefits

1. **Informed Decisions**: Users can make informed decisions about which model to use based on:
   - Disk space requirements
   - Processing speed needs
   - Accuracy requirements
2. **Resource Optimization**: Users can:
   - Delete unused models to free up disk space
   - Choose smaller models for faster processing on less powerful hardware
   - Select larger models for better accuracy when needed
3. **Transparency**: Users can see:
   - Which models are available
   - Which models are downloaded
   - Which model is currently active
   - Where models are stored on disk
4. **Control**: Users have direct control over:
   - Which models to download
   - Which models to keep
   - Which model to use for transcription
5. **Feedback**: Users receive clear feedback on:
   - Download progress
   - Success or failure of operations
   - Current status of models
