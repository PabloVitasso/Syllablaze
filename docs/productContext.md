# Syllablaze Product Context

## Why This Project Exists

Syllablaze exists to bridge the gap between spoken word and digital text. In today's fast-paced digital environment, many users need to quickly convert their spoken thoughts, meetings, lectures, or notes into text format. Traditional methods of transcription are time-consuming and often require specialized skills or services. Syllablaze provides an immediate, local solution that respects user privacy by processing all audio locally.

## Problems It Solves

1. **Time Efficiency**: Eliminates the need for manual transcription, saving users significant time
2. **Accessibility**: Makes content creation accessible to those who prefer speaking over typing
3. **Note-Taking**: Enables efficient note-taking during meetings, lectures, or brainstorming sessions
4. **Content Creation**: Facilitates the creation of written content through speech
5. **Accessibility Needs**: Assists users with physical limitations that make typing difficult
6. **Privacy Concerns**: Provides a local solution that doesn't send audio data to cloud services

## How It Should Work

1. **Initialization**: The application starts and runs in the system tray, minimizing desktop clutter
2. **Recording**: Users can start recording through:
   - Clicking the system tray icon
   - Using configured global keyboard shortcuts
   - Right-clicking the tray icon and selecting "Start Recording"
3. **Feedback**: During recording, a progress window shows:
   - Visual volume meter indicating audio levels
   - Recording duration
   - Option to stop recording
4. **Processing**: When recording stops:
   - The progress window shows the transcription status
   - The Whisper model processes the audio locally
   - The application provides feedback on the transcription progress
5. **Completion**: After transcription:
   - The text is automatically copied to the clipboard
   - A notification confirms successful transcription
   - The user can immediately paste the text wherever needed
6. **Configuration**: Users can configure:
   - Input device selection
   - Whisper model selection (balancing speed vs. accuracy)
   - Global keyboard shortcuts
   - Interface preferences

## User Experience Goals

1. **Simplicity**: The application should be intuitive and require minimal interaction
2. **Reliability**: Transcription should be consistent and accurate
3. **Responsiveness**: The application should provide immediate feedback on all actions
4. **Integration**: The application should feel like a natural extension of the KDE desktop
5. **Minimal Disruption**: The application should stay out of the way until needed
6. **Confidence**: Users should trust that their audio is being processed correctly
7. **Adaptability**: The application should work well in various environments and use cases
8. **Cross-platform Consistency**: The application should provide a consistent experience across different Linux distributions, with special attention to Ubuntu KDE
