# Additional Naming Convention Findings

## 7.7. Inconsistent Boolean Variable in Recorder
**File:** blaze/recorder.py  
**Issue:** Inconsistent boolean variable naming in microphone test functionality  
**Current Code:**
```python
self.is_testing = True  # Line 345
```
**Solution:** Should match other boolean naming pattern:
```python
self.is_microphone_test_running = True
```

## 7.8. Private Method Naming in Volume Meter
**File:** blaze/volume_meter.py  
**Issue:** Private method name could be more specific  
**Current Code:**
```python
def _create_gradient(self):
```
**Solution:** Rename to be more specific about what gradient is being created:
```python
def _create_volume_gradient(self):
```

## 7.9. Recording Stop Issue Analysis
**Potential Causes:**
1. In main.py, the `_stop_recording` method calls `toggle_recording()` which may not properly handle the recording completion sequence
2. The volume meter updates may not be properly connected after refactoring
3. The recording completion signal may not be properly emitted

**Recommended Checks:**
1. Verify signal connections between AudioRecorder and ApplicationTrayIcon
2. Check volume meter updates are still connected after naming changes
3. Ensure recording_completed signal is properly emitted in all cases
