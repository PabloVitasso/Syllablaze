# Syllablaze Progress

## What Works

1. **Core Functionality**:
   - Audio recording from system microphones
   - Real-time transcription using OpenAI's Whisper
   - Automatic clipboard integration for transcribed text
   - System tray integration with KDE Plasma
   - Global keyboard shortcuts for quick recording
   - Settings management and persistence

2. **User Interface**:
   - System tray icon with context menu
   - Progress window with volume meter
   - Settings window for configuration
   - Notifications for transcription completion

3. **Installation**:
   - Basic installation script for user-level installation
   - Desktop file integration with KDE
   - Icon integration

## What's Left to Build

1. **Flatpak Version**: Create a Flatpak package for improved cross-distribution compatibility
2. **System-wide Installation Option**: Add support for system-wide installation as an alternative to user-level installation
3. **Advanced Error Handling**: Implement more robust error handling for different system configurations


## Current Status

The core functionality works well, but there are opportunities for improvement in error handling and system integration.

### Installation Status

- Basic installation works on KDE Plasma environments
- Ubuntu KDE requires additional optimization
- User-level installation is implemented
- System dependency management needs improvement

### Functionality Status

- Audio recording works reliably
- Transcription accuracy depends on the Whisper model selected
- KDE integration works well on standard KDE Plasma
- Clipboard integration functions as expected

### Documentation Status

- Memory bank files are being created
- README.md needs updating
- Installation instructions need enhancement for Ubuntu KDE

## Known Issues

1. **ALSA Errors**:
   - ALSA library path may differ on Ubuntu KDE
   - Error suppression may fail on some configurations
   - Solution: Implement more robust library path detection and error handling

2. **Dependency Management**:
   - System dependencies are not checked before installation
   - Missing dependencies can cause silent failures
   - Solution: Add explicit dependency checks to install.py

3. **Desktop Integration**: âœ… FIXED
   - ~~Application may not appear in menu immediately after installation~~
   - ~~Icon may not be recognized on some configurations~~
   - Solution: Updated desktop file to use run-syllablaze.sh script with absolute path
   - Ensured the script is executable and properly configured
   - Updated installation script to create proper desktop integration

4. **Performance**:
   - Transcription can be slow on systems without GPU acceleration
   - Large audio files may cause memory issues
   - Solution: Add more guidance on model selection based on hardware

5. **Rebranding**:
   - References to "telly-spelly" have been updated to "syllablaze" throughout the codebase
   - Icon file has been renamed from telly-spelly.png to syllablaze.png
   - Desktop file has been updated to use the new name
6. **Version Management**:
   - Added centralized version number in constants.py
   - Added version display in tooltip when hovering on the tray icon
   - Added version display in splash screen
