# Syllablaze Progress

## What Works

1. **Core Functionality**:
   - Audio recording from system microphones
   - Real-time transcription using OpenAI's Whisper
   - Automatic clipboard integration for transcribed text
   - System tray integration with KDE Plasma
   - Global keyboard shortcuts for quick recording
   - Settings management and persistence

2. **User Interface**:
   - System tray icon with context menu
   - Progress window with volume meter
   - Settings window for configuration
   - Notifications for transcription completion

3. **Installation**:
   - Basic installation script for user-level installation
   - Desktop file integration with KDE
   - Icon integration

## What's Left to Build

1. **Ubuntu KDE Optimization**:
   - Implement system dependency checks in install.py
   - Add improved error handling for ALSA libraries
   - Create installation verification function
   - Test on Ubuntu KDE environments

2. **Rebranding**:
   - Update all references from "telly-spelly" to "syllablaze"
   - Rename desktop file and update its contents
   - Rename icon file
   - Update uninstall script

3. **Documentation**:
   - Update README.md with new name and Ubuntu-specific instructions
   - Complete memory bank files in docs/ directory

4. **Future Enhancements**:
   - Flatpak packaging research and implementation
   - Additional language support
   - Improved error handling and recovery
   - Performance optimizations for transcription

## Current Status

The application is functional but requires updates for Ubuntu KDE compatibility and rebranding from "Telly Spelly" to "Syllablaze". The core functionality works well, but there are opportunities for improvement in error handling and system integration.

### Installation Status

- Basic installation works on KDE Plasma environments
- Ubuntu KDE requires additional optimization
- User-level installation is implemented
- System dependency management needs improvement

### Functionality Status

- Audio recording works reliably
- Transcription accuracy depends on the Whisper model selected
- KDE integration works well on standard KDE Plasma
- Clipboard integration functions as expected

### Documentation Status

- Memory bank files are being created
- README.md needs updating
- Installation instructions need enhancement for Ubuntu KDE

## Known Issues

1. **ALSA Errors**:
   - ALSA library path may differ on Ubuntu KDE
   - Error suppression may fail on some configurations
   - Solution: Implement more robust library path detection and error handling

2. **Dependency Management**:
   - System dependencies are not checked before installation
   - Missing dependencies can cause silent failures
   - Solution: Add explicit dependency checks to install.py

3. **Desktop Integration**:
   - Application may not appear in menu immediately after installation
   - Icon may not be recognized on some configurations
   - Solution: Add verification steps and clearer user instructions

4. **Performance**:
   - Transcription can be slow on systems without GPU acceleration
   - Large audio files may cause memory issues
   - Solution: Add more guidance on model selection based on hardware

5. **Rebranding**:
   - References to "telly-spelly" exist throughout the codebase
   - Solution: Systematic update of all references to "syllablaze"
