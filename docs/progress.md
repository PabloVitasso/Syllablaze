# Syllablaze Progress

## What Works

1. **Core Functionality**:
   - Audio recording from system microphones
   - Real-time transcription using OpenAI's Whisper
   - In-memory audio processing (no temporary files)
   - Direct 16kHz recording for improved performance
   - Automatic clipboard integration for transcribed text
   - System tray integration with KDE Plasma
   - Settings management and persistence

2. **User Interface**:
   - System tray icon with context menu
   - Enhanced recording window with app info and settings display
   - Improved stop button for better usability
   - Settings window for configuration
   - Notifications for transcription completion
   - Comprehensive Whisper model management interface

3. **Installation**:
   - Desktop file integration with KDE
   - Icon integration
   - Improved system dependency checks

4. **Whisper Model Management**:
   - Table-based UI showing all available models
   - Visual indicators for downloaded vs. not-downloaded models
   - Model download functionality with progress tracking
   - Model deletion capability to free up disk space
   - Model activation for transcription
   - Storage location display with option to open in file explorer

5. **Refactoring Improvements**:
   - DRY principle violations addressed (see [refactoring_summary.md](refactoring_summary.md))
     - Audio processing logic consolidated in recorder.py
     - Transcription logic consolidated in transcriber.py
     - Window positioning centralized in utils.py

## What's Left to Build

1. **Flatpak Version**: Create a Flatpak package for improved cross-distribution compatibility
2. **System-wide Installation Option**: Add support for system-wide installation as an alternative to user-level installation
3. **Advanced Error Handling**: Implement more robust error handling for different system configurations
4. **Enhanced Model Information**: Add more detailed model information including accuracy metrics and RAM requirements
5. **Model Performance Benchmarking**: Add functionality to benchmark model performance on the user's hardware
6. **Code Quality Improvements**:
   - Single Responsibility Principle refactorings (see [refactoring_single_responsibility.md](refactoring_single_responsibility.md))
     - Split TrayRecorder into focused classes
     - Separate settings validation from storage
     - Implement presenter pattern for UI components

## Current Status

The core functionality works well, with significant improvements in the Whisper model management interface and enhanced privacy through in-memory audio processing. Version 0.3 introduces direct memory-to-memory audio processing without writing to disk, improving both privacy and performance. There are still opportunities for enhancement in error handling, system integration, and code organization.

### Installation Status

- Basic installation works on KDE Plasma environments
- Ubuntu KDE requires additional optimization
- User-level installation is implemented
- System dependency management needs improvement

### Functionality Status

- Audio recording works reliably with in-memory processing
- No temporary files are created during the recording and transcription process
- Transcription accuracy depends on the Whisper model selected
- KDE integration works well on standard KDE Plasma
- Clipboard integration functions as expected
- Whisper model management provides a comprehensive interface for model control

### Documentation Status

- Memory bank files are being maintained
- README.md has been updated
- Installation instructions have been enhanced for Ubuntu KDE
- Whisper model management plan has been documented and implemented
- Refactoring documentation has been updated to reflect completed work
- Pending refactorings are documented for future implementation
