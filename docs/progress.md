# Syllablaze Progress

## What Works

1. **Core Functionality**:
   - Audio recording from system microphones
   - Real-time transcription using OpenAI's Whisper
   - Automatic clipboard integration for transcribed text
   - System tray integration with KDE Plasma
   - Global keyboard shortcuts for quick recording
   - Settings management and persistence

2. **User Interface**:
   - System tray icon with context menu
   - Progress window with volume meter
   - Settings window for configuration
   - Notifications for transcription completion
   - Comprehensive Whisper model management interface

3. **Installation**:
   - Enhanced setup.sh script for user-level installation using pipx
   - Desktop file integration with KDE
   - Icon integration
   - Improved system dependency checks

4. **Whisper Model Management**:
   - Table-based UI showing all available models
   - Visual indicators for downloaded vs. not-downloaded models
   - Model download functionality with progress tracking
   - Model deletion capability to free up disk space
   - Model activation for transcription
   - Storage location display with option to open in file explorer

## What's Left to Build

1. **Flatpak Version**: Create a Flatpak package for improved cross-distribution compatibility
2. **System-wide Installation Option**: Add support for system-wide installation as an alternative to user-level installation
3. **Advanced Error Handling**: Implement more robust error handling for different system configurations
4. **Enhanced Model Information**: Add more detailed model information including accuracy metrics and RAM requirements
5. **Model Performance Benchmarking**: Add functionality to benchmark model performance on the user's hardware

## Current Status

The core functionality works well, with significant improvements in the Whisper model management interface. There are still opportunities for enhancement in error handling and system integration.

### Installation Status

- Basic installation works on KDE Plasma environments
- Ubuntu KDE requires additional optimization
- User-level installation is implemented
- System dependency management needs improvement

### Functionality Status

- Audio recording works reliably
- Transcription accuracy depends on the Whisper model selected
- KDE integration works well on standard KDE Plasma
- Clipboard integration functions as expected
- Whisper model management provides a comprehensive interface for model control

### Documentation Status

- Memory bank files are being maintained
- README.md has been updated
- Installation instructions have been enhanced for Ubuntu KDE
- Whisper model management plan has been documented and implemented

## Known Issues

1. **ALSA Errors**:
   - ALSA library path may differ on Ubuntu KDE
   - Error suppression may fail on some configurations
   - Solution: Implement more robust library path detection and error handling

2. **Dependency Management**:
   - System dependencies are not checked before installation
   - Missing dependencies can cause silent failures
   - Solution: Add explicit dependency checks to install.py

3. **Desktop Integration**: ✅ FIXED
   - ~~Application may not appear in menu immediately after installation~~
   - ~~Icon may not be recognized on some configurations~~
   - Solution: Updated desktop file to use run-syllablaze.sh script with absolute path
   - Ensured the script is executable and properly configured
   - Updated installation script to create proper desktop integration

4. **Performance**:
    - Transcription can be slow on systems without GPU acceleration
    - Large audio files may cause memory issues
    - Solution: Add more guidance on model selection based on hardware
    - The new model management interface helps users make informed decisions about model selection

5. **Multiple Instances**: ✅ FIXED
    - ~~Application could be launched multiple times, causing resource conflicts~~
    - ~~Process-based detection might not catch all instances in certain launch scenarios~~
    - Solution: Implemented a robust file locking mechanism in ~/.cache/syllablaze/
    - Added proper lock cleanup on application exit and signal handling
    - Improved error messages when attempting to launch a second instance

5. **Rebranding**: ✅ COMPLETED
   - References to "telly-spelly" have been updated to "syllablaze" throughout the codebase
   - Icon file has been renamed from telly-spelly.png to syllablaze.png
   - Desktop file has been updated to use the new name

6. **Version Management**: ✅ COMPLETED
   - Added centralized version number in constants.py
   - Added version display in tooltip when hovering on the tray icon
   - Added version display in splash screen

7. **Whisper Model Management**: ✅ IMPLEMENTED
   - Created a comprehensive model management interface
   - Implemented table-based UI for model management
   - Added download, delete, and activation functionality
   - Integrated with settings window
