# Syllablaze Active Context

## Current Work Focus

The current focus of the Syllablaze project is to optimize the application for Ubuntu KDE environments and rebrand from "Telly Spelly" to "Syllablaze". This involves:

1. Modifying the installation script to better handle Ubuntu-specific dependencies and paths
2. Implementing more robust error handling for system libraries
3. Updating all references from "telly-spelly" to "syllablaze" throughout the codebase
4. Documenting the changes and creating comprehensive memory bank files
5. Exploring the potential for a Flatpak version in the future

## Recent Changes

1. **Rebranding**: Changed the application name from "Telly Spelly" to "Syllablaze"
2. **Installation Script**: Enhanced the install.py script with:
   - System dependency checks
   - Improved error handling for ALSA
   - Installation verification
3. **Documentation**: Created comprehensive memory bank files in the docs/ directory
4. **Ubuntu Compatibility**: Added specific handling for Ubuntu KDE environments

## Next Steps

1. **Update Desktop File**: Rename and update the desktop file from org.kde.telly_spelly.desktop to org.kde.syllablaze.desktop
2. **Update Icon**: Rename the icon file from telly-spelly.png to syllablaze.png
3. **Modify Uninstall Script**: Update the uninstall.py script to reflect the new application name
4. **Test Installation**: Verify the installation process works correctly on Ubuntu KDE
5. **Update README**: Revise the README.md file with the new name and Ubuntu-specific instructions
6. **Future Exploration**: Begin research on creating a Flatpak version

## Active Decisions and Considerations

1. **Installation Method**:
   - Decision: Maintain the user-level installation approach
   - Rationale: Simplifies installation without requiring root privileges
   - Consideration: May explore system-wide installation in the future

2. **Error Handling**:
   - Decision: Implement more robust error handling for system libraries
   - Rationale: Ubuntu KDE may have different library paths and configurations
   - Consideration: Need to balance error suppression with useful error messages

3. **Dependency Management**:
   - Decision: Check for system dependencies before installation
   - Rationale: Prevents failed installations due to missing dependencies
   - Consideration: May need to add more specific checks for different Ubuntu versions

4. **Rebranding Scope**:
   - Decision: Complete rebranding from "Telly Spelly" to "Syllablaze"
   - Rationale: New name better reflects the application's purpose
   - Consideration: Ensure all references are updated consistently

5. **Flatpak Potential**:
   - Decision: Document the potential for a Flatpak version
   - Rationale: Would improve cross-distribution compatibility
   - Consideration: Requires significant changes to the packaging approach

6. **Documentation Strategy**:
   - Decision: Create comprehensive memory bank files
   - Rationale: Ensures project knowledge is preserved and accessible
   - Consideration: Will need regular updates as the project evolves
