# Syllablaze Active Context

## Current Work Focus

The current focus of the Syllablaze project is to optimize the application for Ubuntu KDE environments and enhance the Whisper model management functionality. This involves:

1. Modifying the installation script to better handle Ubuntu-specific dependencies and paths
2. Implementing more robust error handling for system libraries
3. Updating all references from "telly-spelly" to "syllablaze" throughout the codebase
4. Implementing a comprehensive Whisper model management interface
5. Documenting the changes and creating comprehensive memory bank files
6. Exploring the potential for a Flatpak version in the future

## Recent Changes


## Next Steps

1. ✅ **Update Desktop File**: Desktop file has been renamed and updated from org.kde.telly_spelly.desktop to org.kde.syllablaze.desktop
2. ✅ **Update Icon**: Icon file has been renamed from telly-spelly.png to syllablaze.png
3. ✅ **Modify Uninstall Script**: Uninstall.py script has been updated to reflect the new application name
4. ✅ **Add Version Number**: Added centralized version number in constants.py and displayed it in the UI
   - Added version display in tooltip when hovering on the tray icon
   - Added version display in splash screen
5. ✅ **Fix Desktop Integration**: Fixed issue with desktop icon not launching the application
   - Updated desktop file to use run-syllablaze.sh script with absolute path
   - Ensured the script is executable and properly configured
6. ✅ **Reorganize Code Structure**: Moved all core application code to the blaze/ directory
   - Created proper Python package structure
   - Updated import statements to use the new package structure
7. ✅ **Update Installation Method**: Enhanced the setup.sh script to use pipx for installation
   - Simplified the installation process
   - Improved system dependency checks
8. ✅ **Update README**: Revised the README.md file with the new directory structure and installation method
9. ✅ **Implement Whisper Model Management**: Created a comprehensive model management interface
   - Implemented table-based UI for model management
   - Added download, delete, and activation functionality
   - Integrated with settings window
10. **Test Installation**: Verify the installation process works correctly on Ubuntu KDE
11. **Future Exploration**: Begin research on creating a Flatpak version

## Active Decisions and Considerations

1. **Installation Method**:
   - Decision: Use pipx for installation via the setup.sh script
   - Rationale: Simplifies installation without requiring root privileges and avoids externally-managed-environment errors
   - Consideration: May explore system-wide installation in the future

2. **Code Organization**:
   - Decision: Move all core application code to the blaze/ directory
   - Rationale: Improves code organization and maintainability
   - Consideration: Requires updating import statements and installation scripts

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Decision: Implement more robust error handling for system libraries
   - Rationale: Ubuntu KDE may have different library paths and configurations
   - Consideration: Need to balance error suppression with useful error messages

4. **Dependency Management**:
   - Decision: Check for system dependencies before installation
   - Rationale: Prevents failed installations due to missing dependencies
   - Consideration: May need to add more specific checks for different Ubuntu versions

5. **Rebranding Scope**:
   - Decision: Complete rebranding from "Telly Spelly" to "Syllablaze"
   - Rationale: New name better reflects the application's purpose
   - Consideration: Ensure all references are updated consistently

6. **Flatpak Potential**:
   - Decision: Document the potential for a Flatpak version
   - Rationale: Would improve cross-distribution compatibility
   - Consideration: Requires significant changes to the packaging approach

7. **Documentation Strategy**:
   - Decision: Create comprehensive memory bank files
   - Rationale: Ensures project knowledge is preserved and accessible
   - Consideration: Will need regular updates as the project evolves

8. **Whisper Model Management**:
    - Decision: Implement a comprehensive model management interface
    - Rationale: Provides better user control over model selection and disk space usage
    - Consideration: Need to handle download progress simulation since Whisper API doesn't provide direct progress tracking

9. **Single Instance Enforcement**:
    - Decision: Implement a robust file locking mechanism to ensure only one instance of Syllablaze can run at a time
    - Rationale: Prevents resource conflicts and confusion from multiple instances running simultaneously
    - Consideration: Uses a file lock in ~/.cache/syllablaze/ with proper cleanup on application exit and signal handling
